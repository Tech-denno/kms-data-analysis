# My DSA Final Project

A Capstone Project completed as part of a three-month intensive Data Analysis program, aimed at generating insights to address key questions in the field of Human Resource Analytics and Logistics Optimization. This project combines SQL querying and Power BI visualization skills across two case studies.

## Project Overview

### Case Study 2:

This comprises Case Scenario I and II, and focuses on applying SQL skills.
  
### Objective:

The aim of the Case Scenario I is to analyze the sales and operational data of Kultra Mega Stores (KMS) and present key insights and findings. While Case Scenario II explores customer behaviour, profitability, and logistics efficiency.

### Case Scenario I:

-  Ascertaining the product category with the highest sales.
-  Identifyinging the top 3 and bottom 3 regions by sales.
-  Calculating total sales of appliances in Ontario.
-  Offering recommendations to increase revenue from the bottom 10 customers.
-  Analyzing shipping costs to determine the most expensive shipping method.

### Case Scenario II:

-    Identifying the most valuable customers and their typical products or services purchase history.
-    Determining which small business customer generated the highest sales.
-    Finding the corporate customer who placed the most orders between 2009 and 2012.
-    Ascertaining the most profitable consumer customer.
-    Highlighting customers who returned items and analyzing the segments they belong to.
-    Evaluating whether shipping methods were appropriately selected based on order priority and in consideration of both speed and cost.

###  Key SQL Concepts Applied:
    
  - Database Creation
  - Import Data
  - Data extraction
  - Filtering
  - Aggregation
  - Querying
  - Join
  - Create View

###  Case Study 3:

This focuses on aplying Power BI skills mentioned below:
  
###  Objective:

The goal is to undertake a Prescriptive Analytics for management attention. In particular, the analysis focuses on the following:

  - The proportion of each gender in the company. Add regional and departmental dimensions.
  - Perceived gender equality ratings.
  - Examine salary distribution across genders to detect potential pay gap. If a gender pay gap exists, identify the departments and regions most affected for targeted intervention.
  - Grouping employees pay distribution by a band of 10000 Dollars and gender.
  - Calculating bonus amount paid to individual employees.
  - Calculating total amount paid to individual employees.
  - Analyzing and calculating total amount paid by region and company-wide.
    
  ### Key POWER BI Concepts Used:
  - Import Data
  - Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)
  - Calculated Columns using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX)
  - Merge Tables
  - Data Modelling
  - Visualization
