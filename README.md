# My DSA Final Project

## Project Overview:
A Capstone Project completed as part of a three-month intensive Data Analysis program, aimed at generating insights to address key questions in the field of Human Resource Analytics and Logistics Optimization. This project combines SQL querying and Power BI visualization skills across two case studies. This project focuses on two case studies: Case study 2, which in turn consists of Case Scenario I and II, and Case study 3.

The aim of the Case Scenario I is to analyze the sales and operational data of Kultra Mega Stores (KMS) and present key insights and findings. While Case Scenario II explores customer behaviour, profitability, and logistics efficiency.

### Business Insights for KMS:
The negative profits in the table above show that customer Christopher Conant has multiple products with negative profit, across categories like Technology, Office Supplies, and Furniture. This could be due to heavy discounts, high operational (shipping costs) costs, or selling low-margin products.

### Recommendations:
- Restrict discounts for Home Office customers on low-margin items.
- Offer bundled deals or minimum order thresholds to ensure profitability.
- Promote higher-margin alternatives within Office Supplies and Technology.


Provide business insights that can help ramp up revenue generation from this customer segment. 

5. Analyzing shipping costs to determine the most expensive shipping method.

-  Perceived gender equality ratings.
-  Examine salary distribution across genders to detect potential pay gap. If a gender pay gap exists, identify the departments and regions most affected for targeted intervention.
-  Grouping employees pay distribution by a band of 10000 Dollars by gender and region.
-  Calculating bonus amount paid to individual employees.
-  Calculating total amount paid to individual employees.
-  Analyzing and calculating total amount paid by region and company-wide.
    
### Key POWER BI Concepts Used:
-  Import Data
-  Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)
-  Calculated Columns using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX)
-  Merge Tables
-  Data Modelling
-  Visualization

### Visuals Created:
-  The proportion of each gender in Palmora company, including regional and departmental dimensions.
