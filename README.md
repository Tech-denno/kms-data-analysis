# My DSA Final Project


A Capstone Project completed as part of a three-month intensive Data Analysis program, aimed at generating insights to address key questions in the field of Human Resource Analytics. This project combines SQL querying and Power BI visualization skills across two case studies.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

- **Case Study 2**, has Cases Scenario I and II, and focuses on applying SQL skills.
  
- **Objective:** The aim of this Case Scenario I is to analyze the sales and operational data of Kultra Mega Stores (KMS) and present key insights and findings. Furthermore, Case Scenario II of Case Study 2 explores customer behaviour, profitability, and logistics efficiency. In particular, the analysis focuses on:The  **Case Scenario I** analyses focus on the following:

  - Ascertaining the product category with the highest sales.
  - Identifyinging the top 3 and bottom 3 regions by sales.
  - Calculating total sales of appliances in Ontario.
  - Offering recommendations to increase revenue from the bottom 10 customers.
  - Analyzing shipping costs to determine the most expensive shipping method.

   -  Identifying the most valuable customers and their typical products or services purchase history.
   - Determining which small business customer generated the highest sales.
   - Finding the corporate customer who placed the most orders between 2009 and 2012.
   - Ascertaining the most profitable consumer customer.
   - Highlighting customers who returned items and analyzing the segments they belong to.
   - Evaluating whether shipping methods were appropriately selected based on order priority and in consideration of both speed and cost.
